# XEncDecTool
 C# Console Application : encrypt and decrypt all type of Files  with symmetric Algorithms 

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
The AES Encryption algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetric block cipher algorithm with a block/chunk size of 128 bits. It converts these individual blocks using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits.

Technology Stack
•	Programming Language: C#
•	Framework: .NET 
•	Libraries:
o	System. Security. Cryptography for encryption operations
o	System.IO for file handling
o	System. Windows. Forms for any graphical interface/message boxes

Cross-Format Compatibility 
• Since the tool works at the binary level, it supports all types of video Files and all other files   (e.g.,
Mp4, AVI, MKV, MOV, WMV, FLV, MPEG, WebM,3GP, M4v, rar, notepad,exe, ms office files etc.)
